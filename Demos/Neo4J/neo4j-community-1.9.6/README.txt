Neo4j 1.9.6
=======================================

Welcome to Neo4j release 1.9.6, a high-performance graph database.
This is the community distribution of Neo4j, including everything you need to
start building applications that can model, persist and explore graph-like data.

In the box
----------

Neo4j runs as a server application, exposing a Web-based management
interface and RESTful endpoints for data access.

Here in the installation directory, you'll find:

* bin - scripts and other executables
* conf - server configuration
* data - database, log, and other variable files
* doc - more light reading
* lib - core libraries
* plugins - user extensions
* system - super-secret server stuff

Make it go
----------

To get started with Neo4j, let's start the server and take a
look at the web interface...

1. open a console and navigate to the install directory
2. start the server
   * Windows: use `bin\Neo4j.bat`
   * Linux/Mac: use `bin/neo4j start`
3. in a browser, open [webadmin](http://localhost:7474/webadmin/)
4. from any REST client or browser, open (http://localhost:7474/db/data) 
   in order to get a REST starting point, e.g.
   `curl -v http://localhost:7474/db/data`
5. shutdown the server
   * Windows: type Ctrl-C to terminate the batch script
   * Linux/Mac: use `bin/neo4j stop`
